Server for Guessify

Info to look into before building:
    1. How to play songs (can we play songs from Spotify on a phone?)
    2. Database information for production (duckdb works locally but 
       don't know if it will work in a production environment)


This to remeber:
    1. Create a requirements.txt file
    2. Create a proper authorization system (OAuth2 maybe?)
    2. Create a Dockerfile

Routes:
    1. /login
    2. /signup
    3. /play_song
    4. /check_answers
    5. /leaderboard
    6. /profile
    7. /logout
    8. /refresh_token
