Server for Guessify

Info to look into before building:
    1. How to play songs (can we play songs from Spotify on a phone?)
    2. Database information for production (duckdb works locally but 
       don't know if it will work in a production environment)


This to remeber:
    1. Create a requirements.txt file

Routes:
    1. /login
    2. /signup
    3. /play
    4. /pause
    5. /skip
    6. /guess
    7. /leaderboard
    8. /profile
    9. /update_profile
    10. /logout
    11. /refresh_token
